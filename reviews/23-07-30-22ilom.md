Summary:

L1 law of leadership

- It’s better to be first than it is to be better
  - e.g. Charles Lindbergh

L2 law of category

- if you can’t be first to market, create a new category for yourself
  - e.g. Amelia Earheart (first woman to fly across AO solo)
  - how do I get people to prefer my brand? think categories. Prospects are on the defensive when thinking about brands; but they are more open to categories. everyone is interested in what’s new. few people are interested in what’s better

L3 law of the mind

- better to be first in prospect’s mind than first in marketplace
  - e.g. IBM vs UNIVAC
  - most wasteful thing is marketing is to try to change a mind
  - simple names are better e.g. Apple II vs Commodore Pet, IMSAI 8080

L4 law of perception

- Marketing is not a battle of products, it’s a battle of perceptions.
  - perception is reality; everything else is illusion
  - all truth is relative
  - e.g. Toyota sells 4x as many cars as Honda in Japan (due to perception of H as a motorbike co.)

L5 law of focus

- The most powerful concept in marketing is owning a word in the prospect’s mind.
  - The most effective words are simple and benefit
    oriented.
  - e.g. Lotus - groupware
  - The essence of marketing is narrowing the focus.

L6 law of exclusivity

- Two companies cannot own the same word in the prospect’s mind.

L7 law of the ladder

- The strategy to use depends on which rung you occupy on the ladder.
  - Prospects use their ladders in deciding which info to accept and which info to reject. A mind accepts new data that’s consistent with its product ladder in that category.
  - 4-2-1 rule - Acura (140k), Lexus (71k), Infiniti (35k)
  - 7 rungs on a ladder (Miller, 1956)

L8 law of duality

- In the long run, every market becomes a two-horse race.

L9 law of the opposite

- If you’re shooting for second place, your strategy is determined by the leader. Find the opposite of what they do, and exploit it.
  - don’t try to be better; be different (upstart vs. old reliable)
  - Too many potential No. 2 brands try to emulate
    the leader. This usually is an error. You must present
    yourself as the alternative

L10 law of division

- Over time, a category will divide and become two or more categories.
  - e.g. Computers -> mainframes, minis, PCs, workstations, notebooks, handhelds
  - timing is important - you can be too early to exploit a new category e.g. Nash Rambler (America’s first small car)
  - better to be early than late

L11 law of perspective

- Marketing effects take place over an extended period of time.
  - P&G - uniform pricing
  - **_Line extensions_** refers to the process of expanding an existing product line

L12 law of line extension

- There’s an irresistible pressure to extend the equity of the brand.
  - One day a company is tightly focused on a single
    product that is highly profitable. The next day the same company is spread thin over many products and is losing money.
  - why do companies line extend? One reason is that while line extension is a loser in the LT, it can be a winner in the ST
  - Less is more. If you want to be successful today, you
    have to narrow the focus in order to build a position in
    the prospect’s mind.

L13 law of sacrifice

- you have to give up something to get something (opposite of L12)
  - generalist is weak

L14 law of attributes

- for every attribute, there’s an opposite, effective attribute
  - marketing is a battle of ideas
  - Your job is to seize a different attribute, dramatize the value of your attribute, and thus increase your share

L15 law of candor

- when you admit a negative, the prospect will give you a positive
  - candor is disarming - shift quickly to positive

L16 law of singularity

- in each situation, only one move will provide substantial results

L17 law of unpredictability

- you can’t predict the future

L18 law of success

- success leads to arrogance and arrogance to failure
  - Brilliant marketers have the ability to think like a prospect thinks.
    They put themselves in the shoes of their customers.

L19 law of failure

- failure is to be expected and accepted
  - Wal-Mart - ready, fire, aim

L20 law of hype

- situation is often the opposite of the way it appears in the press
  - real revolutions arrive unannounced in the middle of the night and sneak up on you

L21 law of acceleration

- successful programs aren’t built on fads, they’re built on trends

L22 law of resources

- without adequate funding, an idea won’t get off the ground
  - money spins marketing wheels

Conclusion:

I really liked reading this book although it was written in 1993, and alot the references are outdated e.g. Blockbuster, IBM, etc. Overall though there are some good laws in there like the law of the opposite where you should try to be different than the leader. Another law I like is the law of the ladder, where the strategy you use depends on which rung you occupy on the ladder.
