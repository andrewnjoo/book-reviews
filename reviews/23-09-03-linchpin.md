### Notes:

Every business is a lot like Hector.

Consumers are not loyal to cheap commodities. They crave the unique, the remarkable, and the human

Linchpins are the essential building blocks of tomorrow's high-value organizations.

linchpins leverage something internal not external

corporate school system

if you're a linchpin, doing a job that's not getting done is essential.

linchpins need to do good work

Emotional labor is the hard work of making art, producing generosity, and exposing creativity.

Krulak's law - [The experience people have with your brand is in the hands of the person you pay the least](https://seths.blog/2020/06/krulaks-law/)

If you seek to become indispensable, a similar question is worth asking: "Where do you put the fear?

You want something remarkable, nonlinear, game changing, and artistic.

**Art is a personal gift that changes the recipient.**

2 reasons to give gifts: reciprocity and art

why is shipping so difficult?

challenges:

1. thrashing (thrash early) [1](https://chat.openai.com/share/e128bf9d-1aed-4c8b-966a-482f46d67e0b)
2. coordination

reason: the resistance

the daemon and the resistance

the lizard/resistance loves school/obedience

> Every creative person I know generates a slew of laughable ideas for every good one.

Here are some signs that the lizard brain is at work:

1. Don't ship on time. Late is the first step to never.
2. Procrastinate, claiming that you need to be perfect.
3. Ship early, sending out defective ideas, hoping they will be rejected. Suffer anxiety about what to wear to an event.
4. Make excuses involving lack of money.
5. Do excessive networking with the goal of having everyone like you and support you.
6. Engage in deliberately provocative behavior designed to ostracize you so you'll have no standing in the community.
7. Demonstrate a lack of desire to obtain new skills.
8. Spend hours on obsessive data collection. (Jeffrey Eisenberg reports that "79 percent of businesses obsessively capture Internet traffic data, yet only 30 percent of them changed their sites as a result of analysis.")
9. Be snarky.
10. Start committees instead of taking action. Join committees instead of leading.
11. Excessively criticize the work of your peers, thus unrealistically raising the bar for your work.
12. Produce deliberately outlandish work product that no one can possibly embrace. Ship deliberately average work product that will certainly fit in and be ignored. Don't ask questions.
13. Ask too many questions.
14. Criticize anyone who is doing something differently. If they succeed, that means you'll have to do something differently too.
15. Start a never-ending search for the next big thing, abandoning yesterday's thing as old. Embrace an emotional attachment to the status quo.
16. Invent anxiety about the side effects of a new approach.
17. Be boring.
18. Focus on revenge or teaching someone a lesson, at the expense of doing the work.
19. Slow down as the deadline for completion approaches. Check your work obsessively as ship date looms.
20. Wait for tomorrow.
21. Manufacture anxiety about people stealing your ideas.
22. When you find behaviors that increase the chances of shipping, stop using them.
23. Believe it's about gifts and talents, not skill.
24. Announce you have neither.

6. The point of being done is not to finish but to get other things done.
7. Once you’re done you can throw it away.
8. Laugh at perfection. It’s boring and keeps you from being done.

resistance = anxiety 🪨

#### 1 way to thrash and overcome resistance

1. write down the due date
2. use index cards etc. to write down every idea (thrashing and dreaming)

sounds a bit like shape up

> Real gifts don't demand reciprocation (at least not direct reciprocation)...

3 circles

1. true gifts
2. circle of commerce
3. tribe/friendlies

> Every artist I've ever met wants to build bonds, wants to cause connections to be made.

### Summary

In summary, Linchpin is an OK book by Seth with some tips and links to other authors like Babauta (Zen Habits) and Bre Pettis (Cult of Done Manifesto).

Hopefully I can use the ideas in this book to become better at marketing, shipping and overcoming resistance.
