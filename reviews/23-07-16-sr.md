Quick summary:

In the beginning of the essay is the Latin phrase 'Ne te quaseiveris extra', which translates to 'Do not seek outside yourself'.

Emerson proceeds to argue that people generally tend to express only half of themselves:

> We but half express ourselves, and are ashamed of that divine
idea which each of us represents.

He then argues that solitude can be a powerful attribute to have, especially in a crowd.

He says that it is easy to conform, and that conforming 'explains nothing'.

On page 9, Emerson argues that one should not defer to authority automatically (Alfred, Scanderberg, Gustavus).

On page 16, Emerson argues that regrets are false prayers. He also says that creeds are diseases of the intellect, and people tend to easily idolize what has been done before.

Emerson also argues that traveling can sometimes be a symptom of an intellectual unsatisfactoriness:

> I pack my trunk, embrace my friends, embark on the sea, and at last wake up in Naples, and there beside me is the stern fact, the sad self, unrelenting, identical, that I fled from... My giant goes with me wherever I go.

Thoughts:

Some of the pros of this essay are the principles of individual freedom, and inner strength and resilience. It can be argued that true fulfilment and success come from being true to oneself, rather than conforming to societal expectations.

On the other hand, some possible downsides of being too self-reliant are that one can be isolated and disregard social responsibility. By prioritizing individuality, some may distance themselves from social connections, which are important for human well-being and a sense of belonging. Similarly, by focusing primarily on individual needs, there is a risk of neglecting the welfare and well-being of others.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, I liked this essay. Although it is challenging to read for a contemporary reader, self reliance is important for one to become effective.
