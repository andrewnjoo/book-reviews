Part 1: TME - Technician, Manager (biz), Entrepreneur (innovation)

Technician in charge = disaster

most biz are operated according to what the owner wants as opposed to what the biz needs

it’s the work you’re not doing, the strategic work, the entrepreneurial work, that will lead your business forward

C4 adolescence

C5 beyond the comfort zone

true trust comes from knowing, not from blind faith.
And to know, one must understand

to grow a business you must have a true passion— for the personal transformation such a process will call for: accessing new skills, new understanding, new knowledge, new emotional depth, new wisdom

businesses that ‘get small again’ die. They literally implode upon themselves

Because if you don’t articulate it—I mean, write it down, clearly, so others can understand it—you don’t own it

A Mature company is founded on a broader perspective, an entrepreneurial perspective, a more intelligent point of view. About building a business that works not because of you
but without you.

C6 maturity and the e-perspective

Entrepreneurial Perspective

What’s important is the business: how it looks, how it acts, how it does what it is intended to do.

E-model: a model of a business that fulfills the perceived needs of a specific segment of customers in an innovative way.
