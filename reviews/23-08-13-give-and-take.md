Review: Give and Take by Adam Grant

Date: 2013

Length: 320

Rating: 3/5

Give and take is a book by Adam Grant that explores the different approaches people take towards interpersonal interactions and how they can impact individual and collective success.

I think the order of success may be something like:

smart giver > matcher > taker > not-smart giver

Notes/Summary:

- C1 Good Returns 😀 The Dangers and Rewards of Giving More Than You Get

- anecdote with David Hornik (VC), Abraham Lincoln
- success depends heavily on how we approach our interactions with
  other people
- Takers 🐺 like to get more than they give
- Givers 👯 tilt reciprocity in the other direction, preferring to give more than they get
- Matchers 👴 operate on the principle of fairness: when they help others, they protect themselves by seeking reciprocity
- Givers are at the bottom and top of the success ladder 🪜
- 1st part is about why givers rise to the top; 2nd part is how to manage the costs of being a giver

  - takers leak clues 🔍 like lekking 🦚 (narcissism)
