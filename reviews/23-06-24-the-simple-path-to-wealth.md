Review: Simple Path to Wealth by J.L. Collins

Rating: 4/5

Date: 2016

Length: 286

Simple Path to Wealth is a book by JL Collins about how to reach financial independence. I personally enjoyed the book as it's relatively short (the paperback is 286 pages). In this review I'll cover the book and my reasons why I like it.

---

The book is divided into 6 parts like so:

beginning

part 1: orientation

part 2: harnessing a wealth building-tool

part 3: magic beans ðŸ«˜

part 4: what to do when you reach FIRE

afterword.

In beginnings, JL talks about some basic guidelines:

- Spend less than you earnâ€”invest the surplusâ€”avoid debt.

- Carrying debt is as appealing as being covered with leeches and has much the same effect.

- If your lifestyle matchesâ€”or god forbid exceedsâ€”your income, you are no more than a gilded slave.

- Avoid fiscally irresponsible people. Never marry one or otherwise give him or her access to your money.

- Avoid investment advisors. Too many have only their own interests at heart. By the time you know enough to pick a good one, you know enough to handle your finances yourself. Itâ€™s your money and no one will care for it better than you.

- You own the things you own and they in turn own you.

- Money can buy many things, but nothing more valuable than your freedom.

- Life choices are not always about the money, but you should always be clear about the financial impact of the choices you make.

- Sound investing is not complicated.

- Save a portion of every dollar you earn or that otherwise comes your way.

- The greater the percent of your income you save and invest, the sooner youâ€™ll have F-You Money.

- Try saving and investing 50% of your income. With no debt, this is perfectly doable.

- The beauty of a high savings rate is twofold: You learn to live on less even as you have more to invest.

- The stock market is a powerful wealth-building tool and you should be investing in it. But realize the market and the value of your shares will sometimes drop dramatically. This is absolutely normal and to be expected. When it happens, ignore the drops and buy more shares.

When you can live on 4% of your investments per year, you are financially independent.

In part 1: orientation, JL notices that Americans carry a debt burden of around 12 trillion. He also gives an algorithm on how to eliminate debt:

- make a list of all debts

- eliminate non-essential spending

- rank debts by IR

- pay the minimum required on debts, then focus on the highest interest rate first

He says not to:

- pay a service to help

- do not consolidate

- do not pay off smaller loans for psychological boost

In part 2, JL talks about how to harness the wealth building tool. Basically he says most people should just buy VTSAX, which is the Vanguard Total Stock Market Index. I agree, although personally I just buy VOO which is the equivalent of the S&P 500 (the largest 500 companies in the US stock market).

A reason why Vanguard is a good company to choose is that it's client-owned and operated at cost versus other companies that have an incentive to charge higher fees like Blackrock iShares (iShares Core S&P 500 ETF - IVV).

In part 3, JL talks about magic beans like why he doesn't like DCA (dollar cost averaging), and also mentions how everyone can be conned.

---

Part 4 is about what to do when you're FIRE (financially independent, retire early). If you can live on 4% of your stock portfolio e.g. $1,000,000 in stocks, that would be an annual expense rate of $40,000, which is around $3,333 a month.

The afterword includes some tips for JL's daughter like

- Avoid debt. Nothing is worth paying interest to own.

- Avoid fiscally irresponsible people and certainly donâ€™t marry one.

- Spend the next decade or so working your ass off building your career and your professional reputation.

- Save and invest at least 50% of your income. Put this in VTSAX or one of the other options weâ€™ve discussed in this book.

- Fund any 401(k)-type employer tax-advantaged plan you are offered.

- Fund your Roth IRA when your earnings and the income taxes on them are low.

- Fund your Traditional IRA once your earnings and the income taxes on them begin to rise.

- During this accumulation phase, celebrate market drops. While you are in the wealth accumulation phase, these are gifts. Each dollar you invest will buy you more shares.

- Sometime in your early to mid-thirties (or 10-15 years after you start) two things will happen: Your career will be hitting its strongest surge and you will be closing in on financial independence.

- Once 4% of your assets can cover your expenses, consider yourself financially independent. FIRE = 25x your annual expenses.

- That is, if you are living on $20,000 you have reached financial independence with $500,000 invested.

- As you can see, being financially independent is every bit as much about controlling your needs as it is about building your assets.

- Once you are financially independent, begin living on your investments.

- At the point you become financially independent, you can decide if you are still having fun and want to continue your career or try something new.

- If you keep working, invest 100% of your earnings. You are living on your investments now. This will dramatically accelerate the growth of your assets.

- This growth of your assets will, in turn, accelerate the growth of the spendable dollar amount 4% represents. As long as you are working, VTSAX can serve all your investing needs. The money you add along the way will smooth the ride.

I also like this paragraph from the book

Over the years Iâ€™ve come across any number of people embracing life on their own terms. They are intent on breaking the shackles of debt, consumerism and limiting mindsets, and living free. They are filled with ideas and courage.

Overall, I really like this book and will rate it 4/5 â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜†. It's a great book to learn more about financial education.
