- Fundamentals

Fundamentals is made of 3 chapters.

Chapter 1 is about how tiny changes can make a big difference. In this chapter Clear talks about how systems are more important than goals.

Chapter 2 is about how your identity is a deeper core from where your habits come from.

Chapter 3 talks about how a habit is made up of a feedback loop with 4 steps: cue, craving, response and reward. 

These steps can be further divided into the problem phase (cue, craving), and the solution phase (response, reward).

Chapter 3 also talks about 4 laws of behavior change and their inversions:

1. make it obvious; inverse is make it invisible
2. make it attractive; inverse is make it unattractive
3. make it easy; inverse is make it difficult
4. make it satisfying; inverse is make it unsatisfying

- 1st Law - make it obvious

The first law is make it obvious and starts with Chapter 4. An important point made in this chapter is the idea of pointing and calling which is used in Tokyo train stations to literally point and call out certain actions before a train moves along; this helped reduce train accidents.

Chapter 5 introduces the idea of habit stacking which is when you do one habit, another naturally follows. For example doing your bed will make you more organized and then you will naturally follow by organizing something else. Chapter 5 also talks about how to use the implementation intention formula like so: I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION].

Chapter 6 talks about how the environment is important because it can help you build new habits or reinforce bad habits.

Chapter 7 talks about how cue-induced wanting causes someone to be triggered to fall back into old habits. One practical way to reduce bad habits is to reduce exposure to the cue that causes it.

This practice is the reverse of make it obvious, as you make it invisible.

- 2nd Law - make it attractive

Chapter 8 talks about dopamine. Whenever
you predict that an opportunity will be rewarding, your levels of dopamine spike in anticipation. Temptation bundling can be combined with habit stacking to build up new habits

After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [HABIT I NEED].
2. After [HABIT I NEED], I will [HABIT I WANT].

Chapter 9 is about herd behavior

Chapter 10 is about creating a motivation ritual by doing something you enjoy immediately before a difficult habit.
