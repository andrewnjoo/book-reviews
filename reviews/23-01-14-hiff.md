Review: How I Found Freedom in an Unfree World by Harry Browne

Date: 1998

Length: 387

Rating: 5/5

I’ve read this book before so this time I skim read it. I guess the part where I was reading again were all of the ‘identity’ traps in part 1.

The book is divided into 3 parts:  part 1 talks about the traps we fall into, part 2 talks about how you can be free and part 3 is called a new life.

traps include 

1. identity
2. intellectual
3. emotional
4. morality
5. unselfishness
6. group
7. government
8. despair
9. rights
10. utopia
11. burning-issue
12. previous-investment
13. box
14. certainty

part 2 includes how to find freedom from:

1. the government
2. social restrictions
