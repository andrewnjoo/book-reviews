Review: The Way to Will Power by Henry Hazlitt

Rating: 4/5

Date: 1922

Length: 119

The Way to Will Power (TWTWP) is a self help book by Henry Hazlitt. There are around 16 chapters and 113 pages in it. In the book, Henry writes about how a person can harness their will power. 

In C1, the author says that the will doesnâ€™t exist. 

In C2, the author says that the intellect is a valet for desires (the deeper portion of the mind). 

In C3, the author writes that if one is to e.g. purchase a Rolls Royce one must be able to pay the price for it. It seems that the author is talking about the energy price of paying.

In C4, he quotes Mill who says that:

> There is no natural connection between strong impulses and a weak conscience. The natural connection is the other way.

> Strong impulses are but another name for energy. Energy may be turned to bad uses; but more good may always be made of an energetic nature, than of an indolent and impassive one.

In C5, Henry says that you shouldn't break your resolutions (commitment to do something). One way to do this is to make fewer resolutions, and to keep more of them.

In C6, the author asks the reader to question the price of Success (material kind).

In C7, Henry argues that a better goal of man should be to increase the social well-being of society, in contrast to Materialism as Success. However, he also says that 'getting on' is OK too.

C8 talks about controlling one's thoughts; Henry says that if you like to drink alcohol, just avoid going to the bar so that you avoid those drinking cues.

C9 talks about the omnipresence of habits.

C10 talks about how will-power is only needed at the period of change.

C13 is about writing a program of work.

In C14, Henry advocates for a cold shower in the morning.

C15 is about 'second winds'. This is the store of energy that comes after you push through a valley of fatigue. One stimulus to break down fatigue-barriers is intensity of interest.

C16 provides some tips like:

1. Don't boast to friends
1. Don't be a prig
1. Don't be stubborn, but have a backbone
1. Have moral courage

In conclusion, this is a great book to read. Although it was published in 1922, it is still useful today.
