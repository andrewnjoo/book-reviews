#### P1 a world that doesn't start with why

C2 manipulation

trade-offs to manipulations

difference between repeat biz + loyalty

#### P2 an alternate perspective

C3 why -> how -> what

🍏 mission

> Everything we do, we believe in challenging the status quo. We believe in thinking differently.
> The way we challenge the status quo is by making our products beautifully designed, simple to use and user-friendly.
> And we happen to make great computers. Wanna buy one?

people don't buy WHAT you do, they buy WHY you do it.

C4 this is biology

- need to belong

> We are drawn to leaders and organizations that are good at communicating what they believe.

C5

- authenticity means that your Golden Circle is in balance
- Southwest airline
- doing business is like dating (Brad)

#### P3 leaders need a following

C6 trust

- value = trust
- Bethune -> Continental
- SW airlines' genius came from finding out why some people were such good fits and developing systems to find more of them
- uninspired vs inspired stonemason (camaraderie)

> The role of a leader is to create an environment in which great ideas can happen.

> Great orgs become great because the people inside the organization feel protected

C7

> The goal of business [...should be] to find people who believe what you believe, the left side of the bell curve

#### P4 how to rally those who believe

C8

C10

the celery test (CT) is when your why is so clear (i am a healthy eater) that at a supermarket if you are holding celery and rice milk then a passerby will know your why immediately. Companies like Disney pass the CT.

#### P5 the biggest challenge is success

C12

walmart - sam walton

Conclusion:

I liked how the book shows the similarity between Why outwards process and the Limbic brain -> Neo-cortex. Some improvements that could have been made are more examples other than e.g. Apple and Southwest airlines, for companies that embody the Why outwards.

Overall though, Start with why is a decent book about leadership/marketing and I'll rate it 3/5 stars.

There's also a decent talk on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp0HIF3SfI4&vl=en&ab_channel=TED) about it.
