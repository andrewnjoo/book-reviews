Thoughts:

In the book it's shown that Ivan lives a life of conformity. As Ivan begins to die, he questions whether his life was fulfilling and comes to the conclusion that it wasn't, as he was too busy trying to please other people.

He also sees that his family, doctors, and friends are uncomfortable with his dying and don't want to be around him. Only the peasant Gerasim is happy and OK to be with him when he's dying, as Gerasim understands that when he (Gerasim) dies, he will be in the same position as Ivan.

It can be said that the amicability of Gerasim is mirrored in Tolstoy's life. Later in his life he wrote [Confession](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confession_(Leo_Tolstoy)>), where he talks about his spiritual crisis. After 1880, Tolstoy's attention was concentrated on the religious life that he believed to be idealized in the peasant, who does not have much and lives simply.

Conclusion:

Overall, I liked this short book. It is a reminder to not live like Ivan:

> most simple and most ordinary and therefore most terrible

Some films inspired by this book are [Ikiru](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ikiru) by Kurosawa, and [Living, 2022](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_(2022_film)>).
