In this blog post I will review the audiobook version of The Beach by Alex Garland, which is available on Youtube. This could be a great alternative or companion to the novel. For example, auditory learners might benefit.

This is a great story by Alex Garland; the prose is easy to follow. The characters are likable, and it's fun piggy backing on the adventures of the main trio: Richard, Etienne, and Francois.

The audiobook itself is well narrated. The narrator in this particular audiobook even does the accents for various characters like Etienne, and Bugs.

The length is around 6 and a half hours. The print edition is 371 pages.

Overall, I would recommend this audiobook to anyone interested in going on adventures. The best part is that the story is available in three mediums including film, audiobook and prose.
